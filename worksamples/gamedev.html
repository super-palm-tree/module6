			<p>For NEWM-N 330: Intermediate Game Design and Development, I was on a team of six tasked with creating a complete and polished game experience. We came up with the concept of a chef working a dead-end job at a restaurant in space who needed to fight a variety of food-themed monsters to collect the ingredients that he would then cook into meals for a varied cast of alien customers. Titled 'The Customer is ALWAYS Right!', the game features three levels, turn-based combat, and a complete story. As the only programmer on our team, I had to work hard to implement all the amazing ideas and characters created by the artists and designers. Check it out on itch.io below!</p>
