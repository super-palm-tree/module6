			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Maeby Neaves, and I am currently an undergraduate at IU Indianapolis. I am majoring in Computer Science with minors in math, game design, and classics. I began my college experience as a high school student through the SPAN program, which allowed me to explore my areas of interest from an early age.</p>

			<p>Currently, I am most interested in pursuing software engineering or data analytics after I gradaute. I love learning and solving problems with both logic and creativity, so the ever-changing field of computer science is perfect for me.</p>
			<p>Outside of school, some of my hobbies include playing board games, listening to music, and crocheting!</p>
